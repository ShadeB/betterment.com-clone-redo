				<h2 class= "footer-heading">Betterment everyday cash reserve</h2>
				<p>*The annual percentage yield ("APY") on the deposit balances in Betterment 
				Everyday Cash Reserve ("Cash Reserve") is 1.78% and represents the weighted average 
				of the APY on deposit balances at the banks participating in Cash Reserve 
				(the "Program Banks") and is current as of 12/02/2019. This APY is variable and 
				subject to change daily. See Current APY. Deposit balances are not allocated equally 
				among the participating Program Banks. A minimum deposit of $10 is required, 
				but there is no minimum balance required to be maintained. The APY available 
				to a customer may be lower if that customer designates a bank or banks as ineligible 
				to receive deposits. APY applies only to Cash Reserve and does not apply to checking 
				accounts held through Betterment Everyday Checking. Cash Reserve and Betterment 
				Everyday Checking are separate offerings and are not linked accounts.</p>
				<p>See Betterment's <a href="https://www.betterment.com/adv">Form ADV Part II</a> and <a href="https://www.betterment.com/legal/cash-reserve">Terms and Conditions</a> for additional information, including details on the deposit allocation methodology.</p>
				<p>
				<sup>†</sup>Betterment Everyday Cash Reserve ("Cash Reserve") is offered by Betterment LLC. Clients of Betterment LLC may participate in Cash Reserve through their brokerage account held at Betterment Securities. Neither Betterment LLC nor any of its affiliates is a bank. Through Cash Reserve, clients' funds are deposited into one or more banks ("<a href="https://www.betterment.com/legal/cash-reserve-program-banks">Program Banks</a>") where the funds earn a variable interest rate and are eligible for FDIC insurance.  Cash Reserve provides Betterment clients with the opportunity to earn interest on cash intended to purchase securities through Betterment LLC and Betterment Securities.  Cash Reserve should not be viewed as a long-term investment option.
				</p>
				<p>Funds held in your brokerage accounts are not FDIC‐insured but are protected by 
				SIPC. Funds in transit to or from Program Banks are generally not FDIC‐insured but 
				are protected by SIPC, except when those funds are held in a sweep account following 
				a deposit or prior to a withdrawal, at which time funds are eligible for FDIC 
				insurance but are not protected by SIPC. See 
				<a href = "https://www.betterment.com/legal">Betterment Client Agreements</a> for 
				further details. Funds deposited into Cash Reserve are eligible for up to 
				$1,000,000.00 of FDIC insurance once the funds reach one or more Program Banks 
				(up to $250,000 each at up to four Program Banks). Even if there are more than four 
				Program Banks, clients will not necessarily have deposits allocated in a manner 
				that will provide FDIC insurance above $1,000,000.00. The FDIC calculates the 
				insurance limits based on all accounts held in the same insurable capacity at a 
				bank, not just cash in Cash Reserve. If clients elect to exclude one or more 
				Program Banks from receiving deposits the amount of FDIC insurance available 
				through Cash Reserve may be lower. Clients are responsible for monitoring their 
				total assets at each Program Bank, including existing deposits held at Program 
				Banks outside of Cash Reserve, to ensure FDIC insurance limits are not exceeded, 
				which could result in some funds being uninsured. For more information on FDIC 
				insurance please visit www.FDIC.gov. Deposits held in Program Banks are not 
				protected by SIPC. For more information see the full 
				<a href="https://www.betterment.com/legal/cash-reserve">terms and conditions</a> 
				and <a href = "https://www.betterment.com/legal/cash-reserve">Betterment LLC's 
				Form ADV Part II</a>.</p>

				issued by nbkc bank, Overland Park, Kansas, Member FDIC. Funds deposited into 
				Checking will be eligible for up to $250,000 of FDIC insurance. Betterment Everyday 
				Checking made available through Betterment Financial LLC. Neither Betterment 
				Financial LLC, nor any of their affiliates, is a bank. Betterment Financial LLC 
				does not charge foreign transaction fees for the use of the Betterment Visa Debit 
				Card outside of the United States. However, Visa charges a foreign transaction fee 
				of 1%. Betterment Financial LLC does not reimburse this 1% transaction fee on 
				foreign ATM transactions or on any other foreign transactions or purchases.</p>

				<h2 class="footer-heading">Betterment everyday cash reserve</h2>
				<p>
					*The annual percentage yield ("APY") on the deposit balances in
					Betterment Everyday Cash Reserve ("Cash Reserve") is 1.78% and
					represents the weighted average of the APY on deposit balances at the
					banks participating in Cash Reserve (the "Program Banks") and is
					current as of 12/02/2019. This APY is variable and subject to change
					daily. See Current APY. Deposit balances are not allocated equally
					among the participating Program Banks. A minimum deposit of $10 is
					required, but there is no minimum balance required to be maintained.
					The APY available to a customer may be lower if that customer
					designates a bank or banks as ineligible to receive deposits. APY
					applies only to Cash Reserve and does not apply to checking accounts
					held through Betterment Everyday Checking. Cash Reserve and Betterment
					Everyday Checking are separate offerings and are not linked accounts.
				</p>
				<p>
					See Betterment's
					<a href="https://www.betterment.com/adv">Form ADV Part II</a> and
					<a href="https://www.betterment.com/legal/cash-reserve"
						>Terms and Conditions</a
					>
					for additional information, including details on the deposit
					allocation methodology.
				</p>
				<p>
					<sup>†</sup>Betterment Everyday Cash Reserve ("Cash Reserve") is
					offered by Betterment LLC. Clients of Betterment LLC may participate
					in Cash Reserve through their brokerage account held at Betterment
					Securities. Neither Betterment LLC nor any of its affiliates is a
					bank. Through Cash Reserve, clients' funds are deposited into one or
					more banks ("<a
						href="https://www.betterment.com/legal/cash-reserve-program-banks"
						>Program Banks</a
					>") where the funds earn a variable interest rate and are eligible for
					FDIC insurance. Cash Reserve provides Betterment clients with the
					opportunity to earn interest on cash intended to purchase securities
					through Betterment LLC and Betterment Securities. Cash Reserve should
					not be viewed as a long-term investment option.
				</p>
				<p>
					Funds held in your brokerage accounts are not FDIC‐insured but are
					protected by SIPC. Funds in transit to or from Program Banks are
					generally not FDIC‐insured but are protected by SIPC, except when
					those funds are held in a sweep account following a deposit or prior
					to a withdrawal, at which time funds are eligible for FDIC insurance
					but are not protected by SIPC. See
					<a href="https://www.betterment.com/legal"
						>Betterment Client Agreements</a
					>
					for further details. Funds deposited into Cash Reserve are eligible
					for up to $1,000,000.00 of FDIC insurance once the funds reach one or
					more Program Banks (up to $250,000 each at up to four Program Banks).
					Even if there are more than four Program Banks, clients will not
					necessarily have deposits allocated in a manner that will provide FDIC
					insurance above $1,000,000.00. The FDIC calculates the insurance
					limits based on all accounts held in the same insurable capacity at a
					bank, not just cash in Cash Reserve. If clients elect to exclude one
					or more Program Banks from receiving deposits the amount of FDIC
					insurance available through Cash Reserve may be lower. Clients are
					responsible for monitoring their total assets at each Program Bank,
					including existing deposits held at Program Banks outside of Cash
					Reserve, to ensure FDIC insurance limits are not exceeded, which could
					result in some funds being uninsured. For more information on FDIC
					insurance please visit www.FDIC.gov. Deposits held in Program Banks
					are not protected by SIPC. For more information see the full
					<a href="https://www.betterment.com/legal/cash-reserve"
						>terms and conditions</a
					>
					and
					<a href="https://www.betterment.com/legal/cash-reserve"

					>.

					<sup>‡</sup>Checking accounts and the Betterment Visa Debit Card
					provided by and issued by nbkc bank, Overland Park, Kansas, Member
					FDIC. Funds deposited into Checking will be eligible for up to
					$250,000 of FDIC insurance. Betterment Everyday Checking made
					available through Betterment Financial LLC. Neither Betterment
					Financial LLC, nor any of their affiliates, is a bank. Betterment
					Financial LLC does not charge foreign transaction fees for the use of
					the Betterment Visa Debit Card outside of the United States. However,
					Visa charges a foreign transaction fee of 1%. Betterment Financial LLC
					does not reimburse this 1% transaction fee on foreign ATM transactions
					or on any other foreign transactions or purchases.
